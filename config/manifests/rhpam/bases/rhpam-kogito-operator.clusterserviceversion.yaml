    IBM BAMOE Kogito Operator is designed for deployment and management of Kogito services from source (only on OpenShift) and every piece of infrastructure that the services might need:

    * Builds a IBM BAMOE Kogito service from a remote git repository and creates a custom image for the given runtime: Red Hat build of Quarkus or Springboot. [See more](https://docs.jboss.org/kogito/release/latest/html_single/#con-kogito-operator-deployment-options_kogito-deploying-on-openshift).
    * Deploy IBM BAMOE Kogito service from user provided image.
    * Setup Grafana Dashboard when Grafana Operator is available in cluster.
    * Create Prometheus monitor object when Prometheus operator is available in cluster.

    **IMPORTANT!** IBM BAMOE Kogito Operator may need Grafana and Prometheus Operator to configure monitoring in cases if you do not provide these services beforehand. If you need these features to be automatically provisioned for you, bear in mind that those operators must be installed in the same namespace as the IBM BAMOE Kogito Operator.
