# Kogito Operator

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/kiegroup/kogito-operator)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/kiegroup/kogito-operator)

The Kogito Operator deploys [Kogito Runtimes](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-runtimes) services from source and all infrastructure requirements for the services, such as persistence with [Infinispan](https://infinispan.org/) and messaging with [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/). Kogito provides a command-line interface (CLI) that enables you to interact with the Kogito Operator for deployment tasks.

For information about the Kogito Operator architecture and instructions for using the operator and CLI to deploy Kogito services and infrastructures, see the official [Kogito Documentation](https://docs.jboss.org/kogito/release/latest/html_single/#chap-kogito-deploying-on-openshift) page.

# Trying the Kogito Operator

You can quickly install the operator in your local cluster by executing the following command:

```shell script
VERSION=<current_operator_version>
kubectl apply -f "https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-operator/releases/download/${VERSION}/kogito-operator.yaml"
```

Replace the version above to match your context (example v1.8.0). The version information you can grab from the [releases page](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-operator/releases).

Alternatively, if you cloned this repo just do:

```shell script
$ ./hack/install.sh
```

The script will download the latest version and install the resources for you in the `kogito-operator-system` namespace.
You can set the `VERSION` variable before running the script to control which version to install.

For further information on how to install in other environments and configure
the Kogito Operator, [please see our official documentation](https://docs.jboss.org/kogito/release/latest/html_single/#chap-kogito-deploying-on-openshift).

# Using Kogito Custom Resources as a dependency

It's possible to use the Kubernetes Custom Resources managed by Kogito Operator
in your Golang project. For this to  work, you just have to import our `client` module in your `go.mod` file:

```shell script
# client depends on the `api` module
go get github.com/kiegroup/kogito-operator/client {VERSION}
```

Replace `{VERSION}` with the [latest release](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-operator/releases).

The `client` module will provide your project with the Kubernetes client 
for Kogito custom resources such as `KogitoRuntime` and `KogitoBuild`.

Avoid importing the whole project unless extremely necessary. The Kogito Operator
has many dependencies since it can connect to different managed resources
from third-party vendors such as Strimzi and Infinispan.

# Contributing to the Kogito Operator

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!

Any kind of contribution is welcome: code, design ideas, bug reporting, or documentation (including this page).

## Kogito Operator environment

The Operator SDK is updated regularly, and the Kogito Operator code typically uses the most recent SDK updates as soon as possible.

If you do not have a preferred IDE, use Visual Studio Code with the [`vscode-go`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go) plugin for Go language tools support.

To use Go modules with VS Code, see [Go modules support in VS Code](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go#support-for-go-modules).

To debug Go in your VS code, see [Debugging Go code using VS Code](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/debugging.md).

We check our code with `golangci-lint`, so it is recommended to add this to your IDE.
For adding the `golangci-lint` with goland, see [Go Linter](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12496-go-linter).

For adding the `golangci-lint` with VScode, install the [Go Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.Go) and enable the linter from the plugins setting.

### Kogito Operator unit tests

For information about Operator SDK testing, see [Unit testing with the Operator SDK](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/golang/legacy/unit-testing/).

In general, the unit tests that are provided with the Kogito Operator are based on that Operator SDK testing resource. You might encounter minor issues as you create specific OpenShift APIs such as `BuildConfig` and `DeploymentConfig` that are not listed there. For an example test case with sample API calls, see the [`kogitobuild_controller_test.go`](../master/controllers/kogitobuild_controller_test.go) test file.

- You tested the feature on an actual OpenShift cluster.
- You've added a [RELEASE_NOTES.md](RELEASE_NOTES.md) entry regarding this change.

After you send your PR, a maintainer will review your code and might ask you to make changes and to [squash your commits](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5189560/squash-my-last-x-commits-together-using-git) before we can merge.

If you have any questions, contact a Kogito Operator maintainer in the [issues page](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-operator/issues).

## Kogito Operator development

Before you begin fixing issues or adding new features to the Kogito Operator, review the previous instructions for contributing to the Kogito Operator repository.

### Prerequisites

For code contributions, review the following prerequisites:

- Become familiar with the Go language. For an introduction to Go, see the official [Go Documentation](https://golang.org/doc/). For an intermediate or advanced Go resource, see [The Go Programming Language](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0134190440/) book.
- Become familiar with the [Operator SDK](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk). For more information, see the [Operator SDK Documentation](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/) and use the [Memcached Operator](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk-samples/tree/master/go/memcached-operator) as an example.
- Ensure that you have all [Kogito Operator requirements](#requirements) set on your local machine. **You must use the listed versions.**

### Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Operator Courier](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-courier) is used to build, validate and push Operator Artifacts
- [Operator SDK](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk) v1.2.0
- [Go](https://golang.org/) v1.14 is installed.
- [Golint dependency](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/lint/golint): go get -u golang.org/x/lint/golint
- [Golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/)
- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) v3.x is installed
- [Cekit](https://cekit.io/) v3.8.0+ is installed

### Building the Kogito Operator

To build the Kogito Operator, use the following command:

```bash
$ make
```

The output of this command is a ready-to-use Kogito Operator image that you can deploy in any namespace.

### Deploying to OpenShift 4.x for development purposes

Prerequisites:

1. Ensure that you [built the Kogito operator](#building-the-kogito-operator) first and pushed it to a registry reachable from the OpenShift cluster.

2. [Operator registry tool](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-registry) is installed in your system and available as `opm` command


Follow the steps below:

1. Make sure that you defined environment variable `BUNDLE_IMG`. This variable will be used as an image tag used to store bundle image (containing all the operator metadata).

2. Make sure that you defined environment variable `CATALOG_IMG`. This variable will be used as an image tag used to store custom catalog image (containing reference to the custom bundle image).

3. Make sure that you defined environment variable `IMAGE` pointing to the custom Kogito operator image tag which you built.

4. Make sure that you defined environment variable `BUILDER` defining container runtime engine used to build and push images. Default value is `podman`.

5. Update the bundle metadata to point to the custom Kogito operator image by running this command:
```bash
$ make update-bundle
```

6. Build the bundle image by running this command:
```bash
$ make bundle-build
```

7. Push the built bundle image by running this command:
```bash
$ make bundle-push
```

8. Build the catalog image by running this command:
```bash
$ make catalog-build
```

9. Push the built catalog image by running this command:
```bash
$ make catalog-push
```

10. Define pushed catalog image as a catalog source for your OpenShift cluster by running this command:
```bash
$ cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: CatalogSource
metadata:
  name: custom-kogito-catalog
  namespace: openshift-marketplace
spec:
  sourceType: grpc
  image: ${CATALOG_IMG}
EOF
```

After several minutes, the Operator appears under **Catalog** -> **OperatorHub** in the OpenShift Web Console.
To find the Operator, filter the provider type by _custom-kogito-catalog_.

### Running BDD Tests

**REQUIREMENTS:**
* You need to be authenticated to the cluster before running the tests.
* Native tests need a node with at least 4 GiB of memory available (build resource request).

If you have an OpenShift cluster and admin privileges, you can run BDD tests with the following command:

```bash
$ make run-tests [key=value]*
```

#### Running BDD tests with current branch

```
$ make
$ docker tag quay.io/kiegroup/kogito-operator:2.0.0-snapshot quay.io/{USERNAME}/kogito-operator:2.0.0-snapshot
$ docker push quay.io/{USERNAME}/kogito-operator:2.0.0-snapshot
$ make run-tests operator_image=quay.io/{USERNAME}/kogito-operator
```

**NOTE:** Replace {USERNAME} with the username/group you want to push to. Docker needs to be logged in to quay.io and be able to push to your username/group.

#### Running BDD tests with custom Kogito Build images' version

```bash
$ make run-tests build_image_version=<kogito_version>
```

#### Running smoke tests

The BDD tests do provide some smoke tests for a quick feedback on basic functionality:

```bash
$ make run-smoke-tests [key=value]*
```

It will run only tests tagged with `@smoke`.
All options from BDD tests do also apply here.

#### Running performance tests

The BDD tests also provide performance tests. These tests are ignored unless you
specifically provide the `@performance` tag or run:

```bash
$ make run-performance-tests [key=value]*
```

It will run only tests tagged with `@performance`.
All options from BDD tests do also apply here.

**NOTE:** Performance tests should be run without concurrency.

### Running the Kogito Operator locally

To run the Kogito Operator locally, change the log level at runtime with the `DEBUG` environment variable, as shown in the following example:

```bash
$ DEBUG=true make run
```

You can use the following command to vet, format, lint, and test your code:

```bash
$ make vet && make test
```

### Remote Debug Kogito Operator using Intellij IDEA

The operator will be deployed over an Kubernetes cluster. In this example we've taken minikube to deploy a Kubernetes cluster locally.

**Install Minikube:**

For installing the Minikube cluster please follow [this tutorial](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/)
```bash
$ minikube start
```
**Apply Operator manifests:**

```bash
$ export NAMESPACE=default
$ ./hack/install-manifests.sh
```
**Install Delve:**

Delve is a debugger for the Go programming language. For installing Delve please follow [this tutorial](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/tree/master/Documentation/installation)

**Start Operator in remote debug mode:**

```bash
$ cd cmd/manager
$ export WATCH_NAMESPACE=default
$ dlv debug --headless --listen=:2345 --api-version=2
```

verify logs on bash console for below line

```
API server listening at: [::]:2345
```

**Create the Go Remote run/debug configuration:**

1. Click `Edit | Run Configurations`. Alternatively, click the list of run/debug configurations on the toolbar and select `Edit Configurations`.  
![alt text](./docs/images/add_configuration.png?raw=true)
2. In the `Run/Debug Configurations` dialog, click the `Add` button (`+`) and select `Go Remote`.
![alt text](./docs/images/add_go_remote_config.png?raw=true)
3. In the Host field, type the host IP address (in our case `localhost`).
4. In the Port field, type the debugger port that you configured in above `dlv` command (in our case it's `2345`).
5. Click `OK`.          
![alt text](./docs/images/remote_debug_configurations.png?raw=true)
6. Put the breakpoint in your code.
7. From the list of `run/debug configurations` on the toolbar, select the created Go Remote configuration and click the `Debug <configuration_name>` button 

Running Kogito operator in remote debug on VSCode and GoLand is very similar to above procedure. Please follow these article to the setup remote debugger on [VSCode](https://dev.to/austincunningham/debug-kubernetes-operator-sdk-locally-using-vscode-130k) and [GoLand](https://dev.to/austincunningham/debug-kubernetes-operator-sdk-locally-in-goland-kl6)

## Guide for Kogito Developers
If you are a new developer looking for information on how to start working on the operator, please take a look at [this guide](docs/GUIDE_FOR_KOGITO_DEVS.md#introduction).

If you made changes in the core/runtimes part of the Kogito and want to test your changes against the operator, please follow [this guide](docs/GUIDE_FOR_RUNTIMES_DEVS.md#guide-for-coreruntimes-team-to-smoke-test-local-changes-on-openshiftk8s-cluster) to test your changes.

## Releasing Kogito Operator

When releasing the new version of kogito-operator in [community-operators](https://github.com/operator-framework/community-operators). One can use `make olm-manifests` it would create the manifests in the `build/_output/olm/<version>` directory in format which the community-operators repo expects.
One can then just copy the directory into the [kogito-operator](https://github.com/operator-framework/community-operators/tree/master/community-operators/kogito-operator) and raise the PR.

Note: One needs to create two separate PRs with this folder added in [upstream-kogito-operator](https://github.com/operator-framework/community-operators/tree/master/upstream-community-operators/kogito-operator) and [community-kogito-operator](https://github.com/operator-framework/community-operators/tree/master/community-operators/kogito-operator) respectively.

Before raising the PR, make sure the `replaces` field in the CSV is correct
