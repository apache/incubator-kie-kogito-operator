Feature: Kogito Trusty

  Background:
    Given Namespace is created
    And Kogito Operator is deployed
    And Infinispan Operator is deployed
    And Kafka Operator is deployed

  Scenario: Install Kogito Trusty
    Given Infinispan instance "kogito-infinispan" is deployed with configuration:
      | username | developer |
      | password | mypass    |
    And Install Infinispan Kogito Infra "infinispan" targeting service "kogito-infinispan" within 5 minutes
    And Kafka instance "kogito-kafka" is deployed
    And Install Kafka Kogito Infra "kafka" targeting service "kogito-kafka" within 5 minutes

    When Install Kogito Trusty with 1 replicas with configuration:
      | config | infra | infinispan |
      | config | infra | kafka      |

    Then Kogito Trusty has 1 pods running within 10 minutes

#####

  @events
  @kafka
  @infinispan
  Scenario: Trusty retrieves tracing events using Infinispan and Kafka
    Given Infinispan instance "kogito-infinispan" is deployed with configuration:
      | username | developer |
      | password | mypass    |
    And Install Infinispan Kogito Infra "infinispan" targeting service "kogito-infinispan" within 5 minutes
    And Kafka instance "kogito-kafka" is deployed
    And Install Kafka Kogito Infra "kafka" targeting service "kogito-kafka" within 5 minutes
    And Install Kogito Trusty with 1 replicas with configuration:
      | config | infra | infinispan |
      | config | infra | kafka      |
    And Local example service "kogito-quarkus-examples/dmn-tracing-quarkus" is built by Maven and deployed to runtime registry
    And Deploy quarkus example service "dmn-tracing-quarkus" from runtime registry with configuration:
      | config | infra | kafka |
    And Kogito Runtime "dmn-tracing-quarkus" has 1 pods running within 10 minutes

    When HTTP POST request on service "dmn-tracing-quarkus" is successful within 2 minutes with path "LoanEligibility" and body:
      """json
      {
      "Bribe": 100,
      "Client": {
        "age": 45,
        "existing payments": 2000,

      }
      """

    Then HTTP GET request on service "trusty" with path "/executions" should contain a string "DECISION" within 3 minutes
