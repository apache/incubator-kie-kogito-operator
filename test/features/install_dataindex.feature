Feature: Kogito Data Index

  Background:
    Given Namespace is created
    And Kogito Operator is deployed with Infinispan and Kafka operators

  @smoke
  Scenario: Install Kogito Data Index
    When Install Kogito Data Index with 1 replicas
    Then Kogito Data Index has 1 pods running within 10 minutes
    And GraphQL request on service "data-index" is successful within 2 minutes with path "graphql" and query:
    """
    {
      ProcessInstances{
        id
      }
    }
    """

  @events
  @persistence
  Scenario Outline: Process instance events are stored in Data Index
    Given Install Kogito Data Index with 1 replicas
    And Deploy quarkus example service "process-quarkus-example" with native <native> and persistence and events
    And Kogito application "process-quarkus-example" has 1 pods running within <minutes> minutes
    And HTTP GET request on service "process-quarkus-example" with path "orders" is successful within 3 minutes

    When HTTP POST request on service "process-quarkus-example" with path "orders" and body:
      """json
      {
        "approver" : "john",

          "shipped" : false
        }
      }
      """

    Then GraphQL request on Data Index service returns ProcessInstances processName "orders" within 2 minutes
