Feature: Kogito Service Performance

  Background:
    Given Namespace is created

  @quarkus
  Scenario Outline: Quarkus Kogito Service Performance with Maven profile <profile>, without persistence and with requests <requests>
    Given Kogito Operator is deployed
    And Clone Kogito examples into local directory
    And Local example service "process-quarkus-example" is built by Maven using profile "<profile>" and deployed to runtime registry
    And Deploy quarkus example service "process-quarkus-example" from runtime registry with configuration:
       | runtime-env | JAVA_OPTIONS | -Xmx10G  |
    And Kogito Runtime "process-quarkus-example" has 1 pods running within 10 minutes
    And Service "process-quarkus-example" with process name "orders" is available within 3 minutes

    When <requests> HTTP POST requests with report using 100 threads on service "process-quarkus-example" with path "orders" and body:
      """json
      {
        "approver" : "john",
        "order" : {

          "shipped" : false
        }
      }
      """

    Then Service "process-quarkus-example" contains <requests> instances of process with name "orders" within 1 minutes
    And Service "process-quarkus-example" contains <requests> instances of process with name "orderItems" within 1 minutes
    #And All human tasks on path "orderItems" with path task name "Verify_order" are successfully "completed" with timing "true"


    Examples:
      | profile | requests |
      | default | 40000    |
      | default | 80000    |
#      | default | 160000   |
