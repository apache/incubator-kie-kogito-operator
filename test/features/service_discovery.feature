  Scenario Outline: Deploy Quarkus onboarding example with native <native>
    Given Kogito Operator is deployed
    And Clone Kogito examples into local directory
    And Local example service "onboarding-example/hr" is built by Maven and deployed to runtime registry with Maven configuration:
      | native | <native> |
    And Local example service "onboarding-example/payroll" is built by Maven and deployed to runtime registry with Maven configuration:
      | native | <native> |
    And Local example service "onboarding-example/onboarding-quarkus" is built by Maven and deployed to runtime registry with Maven configuration:
      | native | <native> |

    When Deploy quarkus example service "hr" from runtime registry with configuration:
      | service-label  | department/first          | process  |
      | service-label  | id                        | process  |
      | service-label  | employee-validation/first | process  |
    And Deploy quarkus example service "payroll" from runtime registry with configuration:
      | service-label  | taxes/rate     | process  |
      | service-label  | vacations/days | process  |
      | service-label  | payments/date  | process  |
    And Deploy quarkus example service "onboarding-quarkus" from runtime registry with configuration:
      | service-label  | onboarding | process |

    And Kogito Runtime "hr" has 1 pods running within 10 minutes
    And Kogito Runtime "payroll" has 1 pods running within 10 minutes
    And Kogito Runtime "onboarding-quarkus" has 1 pods running within 10 minutes

    Then Start "onboarding" process on service "onboarding-quarkus" within 2 minutes with body:
      """json
