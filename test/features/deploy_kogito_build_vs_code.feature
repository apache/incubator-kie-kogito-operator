Feature: Deploy Kogito Build - after assets processed by VS code
  

  Background:
    Given Namespace is created
    And Kogito Operator is deployed
    And Project kie-asset-re-marshaller is cloned
    And Project kie-asset-library is cloned
    And Project kie-asset-library is built by maven with configuration:
      | option  | -Dactive.definitions=dmn-generated |
      | native  | disabled                           |


  Scenario Outline: Build <runtime> binary build with native <native> using KogitoBuild
    Given Project "<project>" is generated by kie-asset-library
    And Project "<project>" assets are re-marshalled by VS Code
    And Project "<project>" in kie-asset-library is built by maven
      
    When Deploy <runtime> project "<project>" from kie-asset-library with configuration:
      | config | native | <native> |

    Then Kogito Runtime "<project>" has 1 pods running within 5 minutes
