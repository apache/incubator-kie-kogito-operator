Feature: Service Deployment: Prometheus

  Background:
    Given Namespace is created 
    And Kogito Operator is deployed
    And Prometheus Operator is deployed

  Scenario: Deploy hr service and verify that it successfully connects to Prometheus
    Given Prometheus instance is deployed, monitoring services with label name "app" and value "hr"
    And "CR" deploy quarkus example service "onboarding-example/hr" with native "false"
    And Kogito application "hr" has 1 pods running within 10 minutes

    When HTTP POST request on service "hr" is successful within 2 minutes with path "id" and body:
      """
      {
        "employee" : {
          "firstName" : "Mark", 
          "lastName" : "Test", 
          "personalId" : "xxx-yy-zzz", 
          "birthDate" : "2012-12-10T14:50:12.123+02:00", 
          "address" : {
            "country" : "US", 
            "city" : "Boston", 
            "street" : "any street 3", 
            "zipCode" : "10001"
          }
        }
      }
      """

    Then HTTP GET request on service "prometheus-operated" with path "/api/v1/query?query=drl_match_fired_nanosecond_count" should contain a string "Assign Employee ID" within 3 minutes
