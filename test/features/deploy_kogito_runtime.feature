Feature: Deploy Kogito Runtime

  Background:
    Given Namespace is created

  Scenario Outline: Deploy <example-service> with Maven profile <profile> using Kogito Runtime
    Given Kogito Operator is deployed
    And Clone Kogito examples into local directory
    And Local example service "<example-service>" is built by Maven using profile "<profile>" and deployed to runtime registry

    When Deploy <runtime> example service "<example-service>" from runtime registry with configuration:
