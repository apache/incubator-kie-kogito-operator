@explainability
@kafka
Feature: Kogito Explainability service

  Background:
    Given Namespace is created
    And Kogito Operator is deployed with Kafka operator

  @smoke
  Scenario: Install Kogito Explainability
    When Install Kogito Explainability with 1 replicas
    Then Kogito Explainability has 1 pods running within 10 minutes
    And HTTP GET request on service "explainability" is successful within 2 minutes with path "health/live"

#####

  @events
  @kafka
  Scenario: Explainability retrieves explainability requests events using external Kafka
    Given Kogito Operator is deployed with Infinispan and Kafka operators
    And Kafka instance "external-kafka" is deployed
    And Infinispan instance "external-infinispan" is deployed with configuration:
      | username | developer |
      | password | mypass |
    And Install Kogito Trusty with 1 replicas with configuration:
      | infinispan | username | developer                 |
      | infinispan | password | mypass                    |
      | infinispan | uri      | external-infinispan:11222 |
      | kafka | externalURI | external-kafka-kafka-bootstrap:9092 |
    And Install Kogito Explainability with 1 replicas with configuration:
      | kafka | externalURI | external-kafka-kafka-bootstrap:9092 |
    And Local example service "dmn-tracing-quarkus" is built by Maven using profile "default" and deployed to runtime registry
    And Deploy quarkus example service "dmn-tracing-quarkus" from runtime registry with configuration:
      | config | enableEvents | enabled                             |
      | kafka  | externalURI  | external-kafka-kafka-bootstrap:9092 |
    And Kogito Runtime "dmn-tracing-quarkus" has 1 pods running within 10 minutes
    And HTTP POST request on service "dmn-tracing-quarkus" is successful within 2 minutes with path "LoanEligibility" and body:
      """json
      {
      "Bribe": 100,
      "Client": {
        "age": 45,
        "existing payments": 2000,
        "salary": 2000
      },
      "Loan": {
        "duration": 40,
        "installment": 1000
      },
      "SupremeDirector": "yes"
      }
      """
    Then Explainability result is available in the Trusty service within 3 minutes
