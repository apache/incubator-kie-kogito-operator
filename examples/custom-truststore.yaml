# Create a Secret with your customized JKS TrustStore.
# Be aware that you can only have one, so add all your trusted certificates to this file.
# You can use KeyStore explore (https://keystore-explorer.org/) to manage your TrustStore locally before creating the Secret.

# Run the following command from your terminal:
# oc create secret generic kogito-truststore --from-file=cacerts=<path to your JKS> --from-literal=keyStorePassword=changeit
# this will generate a Secret with only the file required by the operator to mount this truststore in your KogitoService

# It's a good practice to add a password to your TrustStore. The JVM default one is "changeit".
# That's why we added a key to the Secret to hold this value for us.
# Please note that the key must be named `keyStorePassword`

# Result:

# apiVersion: v1
# kind: Secret
# metadata:
#   name: kogito-truststore-key
# data:
  # keyStorePassword: Y2hhbmdlaXQK
  # cacerts: <hashed file>
---
# Supposed you already have Kogito Operator installed, just deploy your service:
# Attention! The Secret must exist before deploying the service, otherwise your deployment will fail.
