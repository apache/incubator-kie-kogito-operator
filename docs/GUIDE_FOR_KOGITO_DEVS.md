# Introduction
This is a list of tasks/activities that are useful or necessary 
to know while working on the Kogito operator. 
This document is written in an order that is recommended to 
be worked through chronologically as a new Kogito operator developer.

# Installing Kogito Dependencies
## Kubernetes
To run the operator, you will need to have a Kubernetes 
cluster to work with. We recommend using CRC or minikube to 
run a local cluster to develop the operator with.

### CRC (OpenShift)
CRC (CodeReady Containers) allows you to have a locally 
running OpenShift container on your machine. 
[This article](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/09/05/red-hat-openshift-4-on-your-laptop-introducing-red-hat-codeready-containers/) 
gives you a good overview of the product as well where to 
download it and ensure that it works. You will need to 
[create a Red Hat account](https://www.redhat.com/wapps/ugc/register.html) 
to download CRC. It should be noted that CRC can be a very 
demanding application and require a lot of resources to run 
smoothly. The [official documentation](https://code-ready.github.io/crc/#minimum-system-requirements_gsg) 
states their hardware requirements as such:
- 4 physical CPU cores
- 9 GB of free memory
- 35 GB of storage space

From our developers' experience, we would recommend having 
more memory if possible (16+ GB) so that you have extra 
memory to run your other development applications (browser, 
IDE, builds, etc.).

<!-- TODO: move elsewhere -->
To get the command to login as an admin, you can use `crc console --credentials`. 

### minikube (Kubernetes)
minikube provides an alternative to CRC if you do not have 
a device capable of running CRC. The ["Getting Started" guide](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) 
for minikube suggests the following system requirements:
- 2 CPUs
- 2 GB of free memory
- 20 GB of free disk space

minikube can be [deployed as a VM or container](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/). 
We suggest deploying it as a container for a [faster startup time](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/images/screenshot.png) 
(<1m for container vs. >2m for VM). To do so, [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) must 
be installed. Once you have done so, minikube can be 
deployed as a container with `minikube start --driver=docker`.

To deploy using a VM, [KVM2](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/kvm2/) is the recommended virtualization 
software for minikube. Once installed, minikube can be 
deployed as a VM with `minikube start --driver=kvm2`.

To set your default minikube driver, you can use `minikube 
config set driver [docker|kvm2]` such that for future launches, 
`minikube start` will suffice and use your preferred driver. 

You will also need to [install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/).

## Operator
The operator requires some dependencies in order to run. The 
following dependencies are copied from the [operator's README](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-operator#requirements). 
Please ensure that they are up-to-date and still match. Following 
are the specific installation commands/links for Fedora:

### Single Command
Go, Golint, Python 3.x, CEKit:
```sh
sudo dnf install go python3 python3-pip cekit
go get -u golang.org/x/lint/golint
```

On other Linux distributions, it is advised to [install CEKit](https://docs.cekit.io/en/latest/handbook/installation/instructions.html#other-systems)
using [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

### Multiple Commands
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/fedora/) 
- [Operator SDK](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/installation/#install-from-github-release) v1.2.0
  - make sure to set `OPERATOR_SDK_DL_URL` to v1.2.0:
    ```sh
    export OPERATOR_SDK_DL_URL=https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/releases/download/v1.2.0
    ```
- [Golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/#linux-and-windows)

## Examples
To test that your changes to the operator works, you will 
usually want to deploy a Kogito application to Kubernetes. To 
do so, you will need to compile [a Kogito example](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples), 
and there are some dependencies to do so. The 
following dependencies are copied from the [process-quarkus-example's README](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/stable/process-quarkus-example#prerequisites).
Please ensure that they are up-to-date and still match. Following 
are the specific installation commands/links for Fedora:

### Single Command
- Maven: `sudo dnf install maven`

### Multiple Commands
- [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/docs/getting-started/linux/) 
  - set `JAVA_HOME`/`GRAALVM_HOME` environment variable
  - [Native Image compilation](https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/#install-native-image) 
    (after installing GraalVM)
    ```sh
    gu install native-image
    sudo dnf install gcc glibc-devel zlib-devel libstdc++-static
    ```

# Running Operator Locally
To test that your changes to the operator work, you will want 
to be able to run your modified operator locally. To do 
this, you will need to apply some CRD's/YAML's. 

First, start your local Kubernetes cluster and create a new 
namespace.

**CRC**:
```sh
crc start
crc console --credentials # run the admin login command
oc new-project kogito # create and switch to "kogito" namespace
```

**minikube**:
```sh
minikube start --driver=docker
kubectl create namespace kogito
# set all future kubectl commands in the minikube cluster to apply to the "kogito" namespace
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=kogito 
```

After this, you can run these commands from the base 
directory of your cloned operator repository:
```sh
make install
DEBUG=true make run
```

In future runs, only `DEBUG=true make run` needs to be run. 
But if no changes were made to the `api/` folder, `DEBUG=true go run main.go` 
can be run for a faster startup time.

# Building Examples
To test that your changes to the operator works, you will 
usually want to deploy a Kogito application to Kubernetes. To 
do so, you will need to first compile [a Kogito example](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples). 

You can compile Quarkus Kogito applications into either a JAR file 
or a native executable. The native executable packages all 
the Java classes and its dependencies into the executable 
and allows for a quicker startup and lower memory usage in 
exchange for a longer build time. You can read more about 
native images in [GraalVM's docs](https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image). 
Spring Boot Kogito applications can only be compiled into a 
JAR.

Instructions to build specific examples can be found in the 
README for each example. Generally speaking, JAR's are 
compiled with `mvn clean package -DskipTests=true` and native executables are 
compiled with `mvn clean package -Pnative -DskipTests=true` (GraalVM must be 
installed with native image compilation). To build with 
additional profile options (e.g. persistence or events), you 
can separate the profiles with commas: `mvn clean package -Pnative,persistence,events -DskipTests=true`.

# Deploying Examples to Kubernetes
*Note*: The Kogito operator must be running in the current 
namespace in order for the examples to be deployed onto Kubernetes. 
See the section [Running Operator Locally](#Running-Operator-Locally) 
for more information on how to do this.

## CLI
*Note*: Deploying via CLI only works if you are running CRC.

### Installation
You can build and install the Kogito CLI by running `make install-cli` 
in the base directory of your cloned operator repository. 
This will compile the CLI binary to `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` if the `GOPATH`
environment variable is not set. To ensure that you can run 
the binary, add `$GOPATH/bin`/`$HOME/go/bin` to your [`PATH` environment variable](https://opensource.com/article/17/6/set-path-linux).

### Deployment
To deploy, ensure that you have CRC installed/started (`crc 
start`) and are logged in (get your login command with `crc console --credentials`).
You can create and switch to a new namespace with `oc new-project [namespace name]`. 

With the Kogito CLI, there are many ways to deploy an 
application. You can see all the various deployment options 
using `kogito deploy-service -h`:
```
deploy-service will create a new Kogito service in the Project context.
	Providing a directory containing a pom.xml file in root will upload the whole directory for s2i build on the cluster.
	Providing a dmn/drl/bpmn/bpmn2 file or a directory containing one or more of those files as [SOURCE] will create a s2i build on the cluster.
	Providing a target directory (from mvn package) as [SOURCE] will directly upload the application binaries.

Usage:
  kogito deploy-service NAME [SOURCE] [flags]
```

You can categorize deployments into S2I (source-to-image) or binary. Each will 
be covered each now.

#### Binary
This is the type of deployment you will most likely be using 
most often if you are deploying from the CLI for development 
purposes. Binary deployments allow you to reuse the binary 
(JAR or native executable) you have already compiled locally. 

To deploy a binary build, you must first be in the example 
folder where you compiled the binary. In the example folder, there 
should be a `target/` folder that contains your JAR or 
native executable. To deploy the binary, you can simply run 
`kogito deploy-service [app name] target`.

#### S2I
It is unlikely that you will be using S2I builds frequently 
for operator development as it takes longer to build on CRC, 
and it will have to build each time you want to deploy. 
Nonetheless, it is still good to know how to deploy this way.

**Deploying Directory**

This corresponds to `Providing a directory containing a pom.xml file in root will upload the whole directory for s2i build on the cluster.`

Examples:
```sh
# deploying local folder
kogito deploy-service process-quarkus-example kogito-examples/process-quarkus-example
# deploying example from web
kogito deploy-service process-quarkus-example https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples --context-dir process-quarkus-example
```

**Deploying Single File**

This corresponds to `Providing a dmn/drl/bpmn/bpmn2 file or a directory containing one or more of those files as [SOURCE] will create a s2i build on the cluster.` 

Examples:
```sh
# deploying local BPMN2 files
kogito deploy-service process-quarkus-example kogito-examples/process-quarkus-example/src/main/resources/org/kie/kogito/examples
# deploying BPMN2 file from web
kogito deploy-service process-quarkus-example https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/process-quarkus-example/src/main/resources/org/kie/kogito/examples/orderItems.bpmn2
```

## Image/YAML
While deploying via CLI is somewhat convenient, deploying via image/YAML is the recommended method of 
deployment and the only available method if you are using minikube.

### Building/Pushing Image
The first step to deploying this way is building the image 
with Docker. The instructions to do this can be found in the 
`examples/` folder of the operator in the [quarkus-jvm.Dockerfile](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-operator/blob/main/examples/quarkus-jvm.Dockerfile) 
and [springboot.Dockerfile](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-operator/blob/main/examples/springboot.Dockerfile) 
depending on the runtime of the application you're trying to 
build. You will need to setup a [Quay](https://quay.io) 
account (or any other image registry) and login to it on Docker using `docker login 
quay.io`.

### Deploying Image via YAML
Once your built image is pushed to Quay, you can now deploy 
the application onto Kubernetes. 

By default, new images pushed to 
Quay are setup as a prviate repository. You must go onto 
Quay and change the settings for the image to be public.

The YAML to deploy the application varies depending on the specific 
requirements of it. In all cases, you deploy the YAML using 
the command `oc apply -f [YAML file name]` for CRC or `kubectl apply -f [YAML file name]` for 
minikube.

#### Simple
In the simplest case, no `KogitoInfra` or `KogitoSupportingService` 
are required. For example, [process-quarkus-example](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/stable/process-quarkus-example) 
without persistence/events enabled. The YAML for this case 
can be found in 
[`examples/process-quarkus-example-runtime.yaml`](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-operator/blob/main/examples/process-quarkus-example-runtime.yaml) 
in the operator:
```yaml
apiVersion: app.kiegroup.org/v1beta1
kind: KogitoRuntime
metadata:
  name: process-quarkus-example
spec:
  replicas: 1
  image: quay.io/[Quay username]/process-quarkus-example
```

#### `KogitoInfra`
An example of deploying with a `KogitoInfra` would deploying 
the [process-quarkus-example](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/stable/process-quarkus-example) 
with persistence enabled. The YAML for this case 
can be found in 
[`examples/process-quarkus-example-persistence-nobuild.yaml`](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-operator/blob/main/examples/process-quarkus-example-persistence-nobuild.yaml) 
in the operator:
```yaml
# Infinispan operator should be pre-installed in namespace
# And have installed an Infinispan server named "kogito-infinispan" in the same namespace of the Kogito resources
# Follow these instructions to setup the Infinispan server:
# https://infinispan.org/infinispan-operator/master/operator.html#creating_minimal_clusters-start
apiVersion: app.kiegroup.org/v1beta1
kind: KogitoInfra
metadata:
  name: kogito-infinispan-infra
spec:
  resource:
    apiVersion: infinispan.org/v1
    kind: Infinispan
    name: kogito-infinispan
---
apiVersion: app.kiegroup.org/v1beta1
kind: KogitoRuntime
metadata:
  name: example-quarkus
spec:
  # see the quarkus-jvm.Dockerfile in this directory to know how to build your image locally
  image: quay.io/[Quay username]/process-quarkus-example:latest
  infra:
    - kogito-infinispan-infra
```

Ensure that the Infinispan operator is installed in the namespace as 
the comments in the YAML mention, and the image is built 
with the `-Ppersistence` flag. The comments also mention that 
an Infinispan server is required and link to [these instructions to do so](https://infinispan.org/infinispan-operator/master/operator.html#creating_minimal_clusters-start). 
An example YAML you could do this with is:
```yaml
apiVersion: infinispan.org/v1
kind: Infinispan
metadata:
  name: kogito-infinispan
spec:
  replicas: 1
```

# Exposing Services on Kubernetes
Once your application has been deployed to Kubernetes, you 
will often want to check whether it is working properly by 
sending a request to it via an endpoint. To do so, it must 
be exposed.

## CRC
In CRC, a route will automatically be created for the 
service so that the application is automatically exposed. 
You can find the URL for all your applications using `oc get 
routes` where the URL's will be listed under the `HOST/PORT` 
column.

## minikube
For minikube, one way to expose the service is with a 
NodePort. You can do so by using the following commands:
```sh
# get the name of the deployment 
kubectl get deployment
# expose deployment
kubectl expose deployment [deployment name] --type=NodePort --name=[deployment name]-np
# open URL in default browser
minikube service [deployment name]-np -n kogito
```
Note that the Kogito application may not have an HTML page 
to open at the URL, but the command will still output the 
URL which you can then use to test endpoints.

## `$LOCAL_KOGITO_SERVICE_URL`
Certain parts of the operator will need to query a Kogito 
application's URL, and so the operator needs to retrieve 
this URL somehow. For end users that are running the Kogito 
operator inside the cluster, the operator can take advantage 
of Kubernetes' DNS and use URL's that are internal to the 
cluster. 

However for developers running the Kogito operator 
locally, the operator will not be able to access the 
internal URL's. Thus when running the operator locally, the 
[`LOCAL_KOGITO_SERVICE_URL` environment variable](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-operator/blob/33e6b074674ee40d65f6db8b5b8f4e012bb0ddee/core/kogitoservice/kogito_service.go#L25) 
must be set after exposing the Kogito application. To do 
this, you should stop the locally-running operator, run the 
following command and then restart the operator:
```
export LOCAL_KOGITO_SERVICE_URL=[exposed Kogito application URL]
```

# Operator Folder Structure
The operator repository is composed of many folders. This section will cover the 
general purpose of each:

<!-- TODO: ask about unknown folders' purposes -->
- `api/` - Definition for custom Kogito resources/types.
- `bundle/` - Required by [OLM](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/applications/operators/olm-understanding-olm.html). Contains the metadata, manifests, and current CRD version.
- `cmd/` - Code for Kogito CLI.
- `config/` - Files for [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/).
- `controllers/` - Code for operator's controllers (a controller watches a specific resource type).
- `core/` - Bulk of operator's code.
- `docs/` - Docs for Kogito developers.
- `examples/` - Example YAML files for deployment onto Kubernetes.
- `hack/` - Various shell scripts for `make`.
- `internal/` - Internal Go routines not meant to be exposed or imported by other apps.
- `meta/` - Contains scheme and type registrations used by Kubernetes client.
- `modules/` - Modules used to build the operator image using CEKit.
- `profiling/` - Files used to profile the operator.
- `test/` - Code for BDD tests.
- `version/` - Code for operator version.

# Testing Operator Changes
## Adding Log Messages
Once you have made changes to the operator, you will want to 
test if they work. One way to ensure that the operator is 
running the changes you made is to add a custom log/debug message. 
I will now walk you through adding one and parsing the logs 
for it.

The operator uses a `Logger` object to output log messages. 
Various Kogito objects will each have their own `Logger` 
property/object. To output a log message in the file that 
you are working on, search for the word `Log` to see if 
there is another function that uses it that you can copy.

In this section, we will just add a simple log message to 
the `KogitoRuntime` reconcile loop. In the `Reconcile()` 
function of `controllers/kogitoruntime_controller.go`, 
simply add `log.Debug("test debug log")` anywhere in the 
function after the `log` object is defined.

## Parsing Operator Logs
We will now run the operator to see if we can see our custom log 
message. See the sections [Running Operator Locally](#Running-Operator-Locally), [Building Examples](#Building-Examples) 
and [Deploying Examples to Kubernetes](#Deploying-Examples-to-Kubernetes) 
for running the operator and deploying a Kogito application.

If all was successful, you should see something like the 
following in your operator log:
```
[time]    DEBUG   kogitoruntime_controllers.DEBUG test debug log     {"name": "[app name]", "namespace": "[namespace]"}
```

If you have a terminal with scrollback and a find function, 
you can search for your log message that way. Else, you can 
also run your operator with `DEBUG=true make run 2>&1 | tee 
operator.log`. `tee` outputs the operator log to both your 
terminal and `operator.log` where you can then parse through 
the logs in `operator.log`.

## Setting Up Debugger
At times, you will want to step through the code to figure 
out a bug or ensure that something is working. To do this, 
you will need a Go debugger. It is recommended that you use [Delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/tree/master/Documentation/installation#installation). 
Ensure that your `GOPATH` environment variable is set (see the section about [installing the 
Kogito CLI](#Installation)).

You can find instructions for setting up Delve for the following IDE's:
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-operator#remote-debug-kogito-operator-using-intellij-idea)
- [VSCode](https://dev.to/austincunningham/debug-kubernetes-operator-sdk-locally-using-vscode-130k)
- [GoLand](https://dev.to/austincunningham/debug-kubernetes-operator-sdk-locally-in-goland-kl6)

You can also debug from the command line using `dlv debug 
main.go`.

# Raising/Tracking Issues
The Kogito project uses Jira to track and manage its various 
bugs/issues/feature requests. You can find unresolved
operator-specific tickets [here](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KOGITO-4992?jql=project%20%3D%20KOGITO%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20AND%20component%20%3D%20Operator%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC%2C%20updated%20DESC). You will need to [create a Red Hat account](https://www.redhat.com/wapps/ugc/register.html) 
(you should have one from downloading CRC)
to access all the features of the Jira board.

You can also bring up concerns/talk to Kogito developers 
about tasks on the [Kogito Zulip community chat](https://kie.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/232676-kogito).

# Submitting PR's
Once you have completed a Jira ticket and are ready to 
submit it, make sure to run `make before-pr` to ensure your 
code is ready to submit. You should also add an entry to the 
[release notes](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-operator/blob/main/RELEASE_NOTES.md) 
with your Jira description. Be sure to consult the [README](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-operator#kogito-operator-collaboration-and-pull-requests) 
and [PR checklist](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-operator/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md) 
for other PR requirements.
